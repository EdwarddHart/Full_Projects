The goal of this repository is to store my full trading projects, with a view towards developing skills in quantiative analysis and building a career in global markets:

Completed Projects:
- Backtested pairs trading strategy for Brent/WTI
- Developed a machine learning trading strategy using Logistic Regression to predict VIX (Volatility Index) rises, enabling long/short positioning on SPY (S&P 500 ETF) based on macro volatility signals, derived from the US 10 year treasury yield.

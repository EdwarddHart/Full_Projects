The goal of this repository is to store my full trading projects, with a view towards developing skills in quantiative analysis and building a career in global markets:

Completed Projects:
- Backtested pairs trading strategy for Brent/WTI
- Created machine learning-based trading strategy (Random Forest) that predicts when the VIX (Volatility Index) will rise and uses this to determine long/short positions on SPY (S&P 500 ETF).

The goal of this repository is to store my full trading projects, with a view towards developing skills in quantiative analysis and building a career in global markets:

Completed Projects:
- Backtested pairs trading strategy for Brent/WTI
- Developed a machine learning trading strategy using Logistic Regression to predict VIX (Volatility Index) rises, enabling long/short positioning on SPY (S&P 500 ETF) based on macro volatility signals, derived from the US 10 year treasury yield.
- Developed a tool to interpolate credit spreads for IG and HY Bond Indexes
- Analysed the seasonal patterns of natural gas prices in the US and Europe using Henry Hub (HH) and TTF Europe (TTF) benchmark prices. Comparing normalized seasonality for direct observation of relative price swings and peak/trough timing between the two benchmarks.
